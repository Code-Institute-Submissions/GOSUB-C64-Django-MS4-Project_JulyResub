# Context
This project is based around a graphics designer putting their services online to anyone who wants graphical work produced at a good competitive price.


<div id="ux"></div>

# UX

## The Strategy

+ This website will be serving the needs of the design community with quick and easy access via the website to their proposed solution.

+ The main reason for this site is for the owner to not only make an income from putting their skills and services online but also so that designers (albeit web designers/developers) searching for someone to do a particular graphical task, for example design a business card or a website logo. 

  Both those needs are fulfilled by the creation of this website to bridge that gap.

## The Scope

+ The key functionality here would be to design and deliver to the customer what that customer/designer needs. For example they want to spread the word of their new business and what it can offer so they need a digital design to be used on a business card that fits this purpose.
  
  + A user should come to the site and walk away happy with their graphic(s) files for immediate use in their business/project.

  + The site could also offer logo designs, web banners, icon sets and even posters designs and brochure/flyer designs too.


## The Structure

+ If I was a user to this site (and after looking around and being pleased with what I see) I'd look for the link/button/clickable element to follow so I could basically place my order.
+ I'd expect to be asked for 
  + my contact details, name, email adress, phone number via an information gathering form.
  + what type of graphic I'm looking for (logo, icon set, business card, etc..)
  + the particular size
  + a brief explanation as to what is the content of this design that I'm looking for.
  + a follow-up preferable contact (email or phone only) from the site owner/graphic designer to accrue more information to the request after payment 
  + to pay for my design via payment screens.

## The Skeleton

+ 

## The surface


<div id="summary"></div>

## Summary

+ This website has been designed with what the shop owner/designer can do for their online customers by  catering for their design needs whether it be digital or in print. The customer should be able to successfully purchase the product they need and the shop owner will have full administrative permissions to add, delete and update their products online.

<div id="design"></div>

## Design
+ Colours Used
  
  I opted to stay with a good contrastal pair of colours (black & white) because of the visual impact it has. Also the extra colours from the products lend themselves to the browsing experience.

+ Typography

  The 'Lato' font from Google was used extensively for continuity and for its crisp and clear appearance throughout.

<div id="user"></div>

## User Stories / Goals

+ All User Stories are located below

<img src="docs/MS4-User-Stories-FGD.png" width="500px" height="300px">

<div id="dev"></div>

## Developers' Goals

+ It has been my goal as the developer of this website to provide the ability for a graphics designer who has a marketable product to sell it online via the use of up-to-date modern digital technologies.

<div id="wire"></div>

## Wireframes

<div id="feats"></div>

# Features

+ This site features the ability to discern off the bat, what types of graphical design the designer is offering to the user. Namely, print media or digital media.


<div id="present"></div>

## At present

+ Print Media...

  + Business Cards

  + Leaflets and Flyers

  + Posters

+ Digital Media...

  + Icon Sets

  + Brand/Logo Design

  + Web Banners/Ads

Each media category has their own unique size to choose from

For example the size choices of Icon Sets in Digital Media range from 16 x 16 pixels to 256 x 256 pixels.

<div id="future"></div>

## In the future

+ For features in future upgrades of the site, I'd like to implement better communication with the prospective client (the customer) in that they can bring forward their ideas and the designer would 'hash out' a meaning design to suit with a limited number of revisions per design.

<div id="tech"></div>

# Technologies Used

## Front-End

  + Html - Is a mark-up language used to structure the main frontend of the site - it helps to 'layout' what you see in the finished product.

  + CSS - Used to add certain 'styles' to your Html mark-up to make them look better

  + Java-Script - was used to add functionality and versatility to the design of the site.

  + jQuery - was used to manipulate the DOM easier than javascript

  + Bootstrap - used to aid the look and feel of certain pages within the site and also to help with responsiveness of the site in various devices.

## Back-End

    - You use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create, configure, and manage AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as low-level access to AWS services.
