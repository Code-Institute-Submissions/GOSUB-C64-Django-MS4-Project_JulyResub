# Context
This project is based around a graphics designer putting their services online to anyone who wants graphical work produced at a good competitive price.

# UX

## The Strategy

+ This website will be serving the needs of the design community with quick and easy access via the website to their proposed solution.

+ The main reason for this site is for the owner to not only make an income from putting their skills and services online but also so that designers (albeit web designers/developers) searching for someone to do a particular graphical task, for example design a business card or a website logo. 

  Both those needs are fulfilled by the creation of this website to bridge that gap.

## The Scope

+ The key functionality here would be to design and deliver to the customer what that customer/designer needs. For example they want to spread the word of their new business and what it can offer so they need a digital design to be used on a business card that fits this purpose.
  
  + A user should come to the site and walk away happy with their graphic(s) files for immediate use in their business/project.

  + The site could also offer logo designs, web banners, icon sets and even posters designs and brochure/flyer designs too.


## The Structure

+ If I was a user to this site (and after looking around and being pleased with what I see) I'd look for the link/button/clickable element to follow so I could basically place my order.
+ I'd expect to be asked for 
  + my contact details, name, email adress, phone number via an information gathering form.
  + what type of graphic I'm looking for (logo, icon set, business card, etc..)
  + the particular size
  + a brief explanation as to what is the content of this design that I'm looking for.
  + a follow-up preferable contact (email or phone only) from the site owner/graphic designer to accrue more information to the request after payment 
  + to pay for my design via payment screens.
